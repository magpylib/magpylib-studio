# magpylib-studio — continuation notes

Handoff for resuming in a fresh VS Code session. Read this + `README.md` first.

## What this is

The framework-agnostic **engine** for a magpylib GUI + LLM "studio", initially
targeting a **VS Code extension**. It owns a magpylib scene and exposes
everything a frontend needs over newline-delimited **JSON-RPC on stdio**. The
extension (TypeScript, not written yet) will be a thin shell that spawns this
and drives it.

## Current state — DONE & tested

- `magpylib_studio/session.py` — `MagpylibStudioSession`: `list_objects`,
  `get_schema`, `get_values` (set vs resolved), `get_figure` (plotly JSON),
  `apply_edit`, `add_object`, `remove_object`, `set_param`
  (move/resize/repolarize), `reset_style` (drop from doc + rebuild; the property
  tree has no unset), `load_scene` (dict or JSON file path), `load_example`,
  `clear_scene`, `batch` (list of mutating ops in one call, continues past
  failures, per-op results), `to_dict`, `to_script`. **Sessions start empty**.
  **Nested collections**: specs with `type: "Collection"` carry a recursive
  `children` list; `add_object(parent=...)` nests, `move_object` reparents
  (cycle-checked), removing a Collection removes its subtree; `list_objects` is
  depth-first with a `parent` field; `to_script` emits children before their
  collection. `example_scene()`: `halbach` → `ring1`/`ring2` (10 rotated cuboids
  each; ring2 staggered 18° by a _group_ rotation) + sensor path along the bore
  — and **three more scenes beside it** (`EXAMPLES`, `list_examples()`,
  `load_example(name)`), because an example is the shortest documentation there
  is and each one leans on a different feature: a **solenoid** (linear pattern
  of current loops), a **facing pair** (mirror), a **magnet array** (two linear
  patterns composing into a grid), a **parametric measuring plane** (a pixel
  grid whose coordinates are expressions), and **a turning magnet under field
  arrows** — magpylib's own animated-quiver example: a pose that is a _path_, so
  the scene animates, and a sensor styled to draw its own reading
  (`pixel.field.symbol = arrow3d`). All four are **written the way the studio is
  meant to be used**: the Halbach is two rings of one magnet and one circular
  pattern each — nine steps and four variables instead of twenty declared
  magnets and sixty-five steps, for a field identical to the hand-built version
  it replaced. Changing `n` rebuilds both rings and `stagger` follows it, being
  `360/(2*n)` by definition. Every shipped scene is sized in **SI units, as a
  real assembly**: the Halbach is 10 mm cubes on a 23 mm ring, not the metre-
  wide magnet `dimension=[1, 1, 1]` asks for. The soft minimum on `radius` is
  0.016 for a real reason: below it, 2πr < n·side and the default ring's cubes
  would have to overlap. Object specs support an optional `"rotations"` list ({angle, axis,
  anchor?}, applied in order via `rotate_from_angax`; no anchor = spin in place;
  on a Collection rotates the whole group). Structural edits go through
  `_mutate_doc`: mutate doc → rebuild scene; on failure the old doc is restored
  and the error reported (`{"ok": false}`).
- **Clipboard & visibility**: `copy_object(id, parent?)` duplicates a spec
  (subtree included) with magpylib's label convention (`Cube_01`, `Cube_02`) and
  unique ids; `set_visible(id, bool)` hides via magpylib's own switches
  (`_HIDE_STYLE` = `model3d.showdefault: False` + `path.show: False`, applied to
  leaf specs, prior values kept in `hidden_style` for exact restore) — **not**
  by dropping objects from the figure, so the object keeps its slot in
  magpylib's colour sequence and nothing else is recoloured. Hidden sources
  still contribute to `get_field`. Tree: rename (F2/Enter), copy/cut/paste
  (Cmd+C/X/V), delete, and an inline eye toggle; hidden items show an eye-closed
  icon and "· hidden".
- **Physics properties**: `get_params(object_id)` introspects the live object
  for the editable constructor params (polarization, dimension, diameter,
  current, moment, vertices, faces, pixel) with value, kind
  (scalar/vector/matrix) and a doc string; written back via `set_param`.
  Position/orientation are excluded — they are transform-managed. Shown as the
  Inspector's **properties** section, and prompted (prefilled, with units) when
  adding an object.
- **The document IS the log.** `doc["events"]` is the whole scene: `create`,
  `remove` and `reparent` alongside the transforms and `duplicate_around`.
  `doc["objects"]` is a **projection**, rebuilt by `_project()` on every build
  and never written to — strip it from a document and the log reconstructs the
  same scene, ids, parents, field and all (there is a test for exactly that).
  Two stored representations of one structure would drift, so there is only one.
  - `_build` is a single pass: create → construct and attach, remove → detach
    the subtree, reparent → move it, transforms → replay. `_create` accepts
    either form of nesting: `parent` on the child (what the API records) or
    `children` on the Collection (what a script's `Collection(a, b)` means).
  - **What an object _is_ lives on its create event**, so `set_param`,
    `apply_edit`, `reset_style` and `set_visible` edit that event in place
    rather than appending. Same reason a CAD history lets you change the box you
    made instead of recording that you changed it — and it keeps the log from
    growing without bound while a slider is dragged. This is also what makes
    "change that magnet's dimensions after the fact" work: it is an edit to the
    step that made it, reachable from the Inspector _and_ from the ✎ on its
    Construction row, which offers the constructor parameters.
  - **A pose pin supersedes the pin it follows.** `set_transform` writes
    `position`/`orientation` events, and the Inspector's position field calls it
    on every change — so without coalescing, four nudges left eight entries, six
    of them dead. It now rewrites the trailing pair when they are the last thing
    in the log and belong to the same object; once anything else has happened,
    order matters and it appends.
  - **What happened _to_ it is appended**: transforms, removals, reparents. A
    removal does not delete the earlier events; they ran while the object
    existed. A reparent's position in the log is what decides which group
    transforms carried it, which is why it is not a rewrite of the create.
  - **One bad event does not break the document.** The fold catches per-event
    failures into `self._broken` and carries on, so the rest of the log still
    describes a scene to look at while fixing the entry that went wrong.
    `get_events` marks those entries with `error`.
  - **Strict for ordinary edits, tolerant for edits to the log.** Any normal
    mutation that would break something is rolled back and reported, as before.
    `edit_event` / `move_event` / `remove_event` go through `_edit_log` instead:
    they apply and return what fell over under `"broken"` — refusing would mean
    history is only editable when nothing depends on it, which is not the
    interesting case. The edited event itself must still work; if it is the
    thing that cannot replay, the edit is undone. `load_scene` is tolerant too:
    a document may hold broken events, so it has to be able to open again.
  - Consequences worth knowing: an event cannot be reordered above its object's
    create (it lands in `broken`, naming the object), and a document with
    neither `objects` nor `events` is now rejected by `load_scene` rather than
    read as an empty scene.
- **Transforms — the doc records magpylib CALLS, not derived poses**, and they
  live in that same ordered log, not per object. Each event is
  `{id, target, op, ...}` with op in (`move`, `rotate_from_angax`,
  `rotate_from_rotvec`, `position`, `orientation`); `_build` constructs every
  object and then folds the log over them in order, so magpylib still owns all
  semantics: paths, anchors, `start`, and **a Collection transform carrying its
  whole subtree**. Objects can be constructed up front because a Collection's
  _constructor_ does not move the children handed to it — only its
  position/orientation setters do, and those are events like any other. Legacy
  docs (per-object `transforms`/`rotations`) fold into the log on load via
  `_migrate_events`, children before parents, which is the order the old
  per-object build replayed them in — verified pose- and field-identical on the
  example scene. Session API: `move`, `rotate`, `set_transform` (absolute WORLD
  pose — recorded at the end of the log, so **no parent-frame correction is
  needed** and the old `_parent_frame` probe is gone), `clear_path`,
  `get_transform`. Undoable, batchable, exported verbatim by `to_script`. UI:
  Inspector **transform** section, Scene-tree **inline hover icons** (move,
  rotate, + on collections) and a **Transform** submenu; move and rotate first
  ask _single step or N-step path_. LM tools `#magpyMove`, `#magpyRotate`,
  `#magpyPose`.
- **The log is editable — this is the ANSYS-style history, engine side only so
  far.** `get_events()` lists it with a rendered `source` line per event;
  `edit_event(id, changes)`, `remove_event(id)`, `move_event(id, index)` mutate
  it. Editing an early event re-applies every later one for free, because
  `_build` always folds the whole log (1.7 ms for the 24-object example) — no
  invalidation machinery, unlike a solver-backed tool where re-running is
  expensive. Events that cannot replay (unknown target, bad axis) roll back
  through `_mutate_doc` and are reported. `remove_object` drops its subtree's
  events, `copy_object` clones them onto the new ids. **Not yet:** any dedicated
  UI for it (the script tab is the editor).
- **Variables + expressions** (`magpylib_studio/expressions.py`):
  `doc["variables"]` holds numbers or expressions over each other, and any value
  in a param or event field may be one. The rule is spreadsheet-style: a string
  starting with `=` is an expression, anything else is a literal — so `"z"`
  stays an axis name and `"=360/n"` is arithmetic, with no per-field whitelist.
  Evaluated from the AST against an allow-list (arithmetic, a handful of math
  functions, `pi`/`e`/`tau`), never `eval` — a document is something you open
  from someone else. Expressions are stored in canonical spacing so the script
  tab is a fixed point from the first save. API: `get_variables`,
  `set_variable`, `rename_variable`, `remove_variable`; a definition that
  cycles, is unknown, or that some object rejects rolls back. A rename rewrites
  every expression that names it through the AST and not the text — `n` occurs
  inside `turns` and inside the axis name `"n"`, and neither is the variable —
  so the name is as editable as the value and the scene comes out unchanged.
  `to_script` emits them as real Python assignments, so the exported script is
  parametric too.
- **The rule is visible, and says so as you type.** `expression_help()` returns
  the operators, functions and constants **read off the allow-list that enforces
  them**, so the help cannot drift from what evaluates — there is a test
  comparing the two, and its examples are themselves checked. The Variables
  panel shows it under "what can go in a value"; every variable input box
  carries a one-line version as placeholder text and validates through
  `check_expression()`, which names what went wrong ("'sinh' is not one of the
  functions an expression may call", "Subscript is not allowed in an
  expression") while it is being typed rather than after it is rejected. Names
  are deliberately _not_ checked there: one that does not exist yet is well
  formed, and gets offered for creation instead.
- **Sweeps**: `sweep(variable, values, sensor_id?/points?, field?)` re-folds the
  document once per value and reads the field; `get_sweep_figure(...)` plots it
  (one hue light→dark over observation points — same quantity in different
  places, not unrelated series). Nothing is recorded in history and the document
  ends on the value it started on. This is what variables are _for_, and it is
  only affordable because a rebuild is milliseconds.
- **Pattern events**, the CAD feature family: ONE event standing for N copies.
  `duplicate_around(id, count, axis?, anchor?, spin?)` is the **circular** one,
  each copy optionally spun by `spin`×index (a Halbach ring is
  `spin = 360/count`); `duplicate_along(id, count, step)` is the **linear** one.
  **A rectangular grid is the linear pattern applied twice** — to the object,
  then to the Collection holding it — so there is no grid op to keep in step
  with the other two; composing the log already expresses it, and both counts
  stay editable (`nx`, `ny`). `mirror(id, plane?, normal?, anchor?)` is the
  **reflection**, and is the one with real physics in it:
  - a reflection has determinant −1 and an orientation is a _proper_ rotation,
    so a mirrored frame cannot be stored as one; and polarization is an
    **axial** vector, so its component along the normal survives while the
    tangential ones reverse — the opposite of what position does. "The
    polarization is in the local frame so nothing changes" gives the wrong
    magnet.
  - both are solved by borrowing the body's own z-flip symmetry `T`:
    `orientation' = S·R·T` (proper again) and `polarization' = −T·J`. The test
    checks it against physics rather than against itself: **B** is axial too, so
    the copy's field at the mirrored point must come out as `2(B·n)n − B`, for a
    magnet in a thoroughly general pose.
  - only shapes with that symmetry can be reflected (Cuboid, Cylinder,
    CylinderSegment, Sphere, Dipole, Sensor). A Tetrahedron, mesh or Polyline is
    refused by name: reflecting it means flipping its vertices, which is a
    different object rather than the same one placed differently.
  - magpylib has no mirror, so `to_script` emits a `_mirror` helper
    (`_MIRROR_HELPER`) and calls it — the script stays runnable _and_
    parametric, the copy still following whatever the source does, and
    `parse_script` reads the call back so the round trip is exact. Path-driven
    patterns are the family member still missing. **A removal takes the copies
    with it** — they are part of the object they came from, and left behind they
    were invisible (nothing lists a copy whose source is gone) while still
    standing in the scene and contributing to every field it computed.
    **`to_script` emits only what happened to objects the log still holds**,
    since a removed object leaves no definition and a step naming it was a
    `NameError` in the exported file. Both are invariants in the tests now,
    checked across every example rather than in one scene. **Copies are named
    after their source, numbered like their id** (`r1#3` → "Magnet 1 #3"), by
    `_name_copy` at the fold and by a line the loop emits into the script.
    magpylib's `copy()` increments a trailing number in the label, which is
    right for copying one object by hand and wrong for a pattern: every copy
    comes from the same source, so a ring of ten arrived as one "Magnet 1" and
    nine identical "Magnet 2"s — a name already belonging to a different magnet
    in the same scene. `parse_script` skips that assignment (it is regenerated
    from the source), so the round trip stays exact. In the UI all three are
    behind one **Pattern…** command that asks which kind first, because they are
    the same idea about a different thing. `count` and `spin` may be
    expressions, so the whole arrangement is one number to edit. The copies are
    generated at build time, registered in `_objs` (so they are real field
    sources and real geometry) and reported by `list_objects` with a `derived`
    key naming their source — they have no spec, so they are not individually
    editable. The source must sit in a Collection: that is where the copies go,
    and it is what lets the event export as plain runnable magpylib
    (`for i in range(1, n): …copy()…`) — a loop shape `parse_script` reads
    straight back into the event.
- **NaN never reaches the wire.** Magpylib lifts the pen between the segments
  of a trace with NaN (the arrows along a current path), and `json.dumps`
  writes that as a bare `NaN` token, which `JSON.parse` rejects —
  `engineClient.handleLine` then drops the response *without resolving its
  request*, so the panel waits on a scene that already exists. `threejs.
  _json_coordinates` sends `null` instead and `scene3d.withPenLifts` restores
  the NaN; `boundByFinitePoints` bounds a trace by its real points, because a
  NaN vertex makes the bounding sphere NaN and `fitView` then aims the camera
  at nothing. Both halves are covered by `harness/check-scene-bounds.js` (in
  `npm run compile`) and by `test_the_scene_payload_is_json_the_view_can_parse`.
- **Field maps**: `get_field_map(plane?, offset?, component?, log?, sensor_id?)`
  — plotly heatmap on a plane. Colour by job (dataviz skill): sequential one-hue
  blue for magnitude, diverging blue↔grey↔red with `zmid=0` for signed
  components, never a rainbow; axes locked 1:1; `log` for the orders-of-
  magnitude falloff. With `sensor_id` it reads a **Sensor's pixel grid** instead
  (`set_pixel_grid(id, plane, size, resolution)`) — magpylib's own mechanism, so
  the plane is a real scene object that tilts with the sensor and exports to the
  script. Both sizes **follow the scene**: an omitted `size`, and the default
  `extent`, come from `_scene_extent()`, which is the span of the objects (their
  own size, or a wire's vertices, when there is only one) rather than the
  one-metre floor it used to have — a constant in metres maps a 23 mm halbach as
  a single bright pixel. Sensor paths add a leading dimension to `getB`; the map uses the last
  path step. **The Field panel can now choose that source**: its map mode has an
  "on a plane / off a sensor" selector built from `list_objects`, which reports
  `pixels: [rows, cols]` for any Sensor carrying a grid, and defaults to a
  sensor when the scene has one — without it, `get_field_map(sensor_id=…)`
  existed but was unreachable from the UI, which made the pixel-grid example
  pointless.
- **Field evaluation**: `get_field(sensor_id?, points?, field?)` — summed **B,
  H, J or M** of all leaf sources (`_FIELDS` maps each to its magpylib getter
  and unit; J and M are zero outside a magnet and constant inside it, which
  makes them the quick way to see what a shape covers) along a sensor path or
  explicit points (numeric, for `#magpyField`).
  `get_field_figure(output?, animation?, template?)` delegates to **magpylib's
  own 2D rendering** (`show(output="B"|"Bx"|...)`) — field at the scene's
  sensors along their paths, animatable. Shown in a dedicated on-demand **Field
  panel** ($(graph-line) icon / "Open Field View") with an output selector, not
  embedded in the 3D view.
- **Script import**: `magpylib_studio/importer.py` + `load_script(path, scene?)`
  — run an existing magpylib script with **show() intercepted**: each show()
  call the script makes is captured as a scene candidate (what its author
  considered "the scene"), plus an "all script objects" fallback when that
  differs; candidates cached, `load_captured(scene)` switches (each load one
  undoable step). **Orientation paths** import exactly via the second
  rotations-entry form `{"rotvec": [[x,y,z],...], "start": 0}`
  (rotate_from_rotvec, elementwise over the path); **path-valued properties**
  (polarization/current/… — from the branch improve-style is based on)
  round-trip through constructor params untouched. Extension: "Import Python
  Script…" command, right-click a `.py` → "Open in Magpylib Studio", welcome
  link, and a post-import "Switch Scene…" prompt + "Switch Imported Scene…"
  palette command when several candidates exist.
- `magpylib_studio/rpc.py` — JSON-RPC stdio loop (`serve`), method allow-list.
- `magpylib_studio/__main__.py` — `python -m magpylib_studio`.
- `tests/test_session.py` — 29 tests, **all green**, ruff clean
  (`uvx ruff check`).
- Verified: real subprocess driven through pipes; scene document round-trips
  through rebuild; `to_script()` emits code that executes and reproduces edits;
  invalid edits are reported (`{"ok": false, "error": ...}`) not raised.
- `vscode-extension/` — the TS shell, **compiles clean, smoke-tested**:
  - `src/engineClient.ts` — promise-based RPC client (spawns the engine, owns
    the request-id space, line-buffered stdout, rejects on engine exit).
  - `src/extension.ts` — `openStudio` command → webview (bundled plotly.js 3.x
    via webview URI + CSP nonce, `uirevision` holds the camera, object picker,
    schema + set-values panes, manual edit form) and six **`vscode.lm` Language
    Model Tools**: `#magpyObjects`, `#magpySchema`, `#magpyEdit`, `#magpyAdd`,
    `#magpyRemove`, `#magpyParam` (successful edits auto-refresh the panel). One
    shared engine process. Tool names declared in package.json must exactly
    match those registered in `registerLmTools`.
  - `src/sceneTree.ts` + activity-bar **Scene view** (`media/magnet.svg`, drawn
    after the magpylib logo — magnet/magpie/chip silhouette; the activity bar
    renders it as an alpha mask): clickable tree of scene objects; context menu
    Move to… / New Collection… (on collections; also view-title overflow) /
    Remove Object / Reset Style. **Drag & drop** reparents
    (`TreeDragAndDropController` → `move_object`): onto a Collection = move in,
    onto a plain object = move next to it, onto empty space = move to scene
    root; cycles rejected by the engine.
  - `src/inspectorView.ts` — **Inspector** sidebar webview view: schema-driven
    widgets (enum → dropdown, format:color → picker+text, bounded number →
    slider, boolean → tri-state '(default)'/true/false), resolved values
    prefilled, set paths bold + ↺ per-path reset (`reset_style`), filter box.
    '(default)' / empty input resets the path. Skips free-form specs
    (`model3d.data`, `path.frames`).
  - **Variables view** (`variablesView.ts`) — a **webview, not a tree**. A
    TreeItem holds a label and an icon and nothing else, and the point of
    bounding a variable is to be able to _drag_ it, so the panel showing the
    variables has to be one that can hold a slider. Each row is name, slider
    (when bounds give it a span), value box, and ⋯ / ✕ buttons; per-row actions
    are buttons rather than a context menu, which is what the change cost. The
    title bar keeps `+ New Variable…` and Sweep…, which work for webview views.
    The value box takes `2.5` or `gap*2`; the `=` marker the document uses is
    added for you. A variable defined by an expression shows no slider — its
    value belongs to the expression — and one with no bounds says "no range"
    rather than silently offering nothing. **Set Bounds…** (the ⋯ button) asks
    for the allowed range and then the slider range.
  - **A range is offered wherever a variable is born** — after the value, in
    both `+ New Variable…` and the auto-create prompt that fires when a typed
    expression names something new. Enter skips it. Only the _allowed_ range is
    asked for there (the slider falls back to it; Set Bounds… covers the soft
    range for when the two differ), and `"0,"` / `", 10"` give a half-open
    range. Asking at creation is the difference between a slider that exists and
    one nobody finds.
  - **`integer`** marks a variable that counts things (`n`, `turns`, `nx`). It
    lives beside the bounds because it is the same kind of statement — a
    constraint on the domain, not a hint for the slider — and it is enforced the
    same way, at the fold, wherever the value came from: an expression that
    lands on 10.5 is refused like a typed 7.3. The patterns now refuse a
    fractional count too (`_whole`) instead of `int()`-ing it, which was a
    silent way to end up with one magnet fewer than the scene claimed. **Units
    are the obvious next tenant of that dict** and deliberately not there yet:
    nothing consumes them, and a slot nothing reads is a promise rather than a
    feature.
  - **Bounds, hard and soft** (`doc["variable_bounds"]`, `set_variable_bounds`):
    hard `min`/`max` are enforced **in `_build`**, not where a value is typed,
    so they hold however the variable arrived — including when it is driven by
    another variable's expression, which is the case a validate-on-input check
    would miss. Soft `soft_min`/`soft_max` constrain nothing; they are the range
    worth dragging or sweeping through, must lie inside the hard ones, and are
    what a slider spans (falling back to the hard range). Bounds are editor
    metadata: a script has nowhere to put them, so `apply_script` carries them
    across for variables that survived the edit rather than dropping them on
    every save, and `_canonical` deletes any whose variable is gone.
  - **The history lives in the Scene tree, under the object it happened to.**
    Each object expands to its own steps ("created", "orbit 36° about z") before
    its children, so reading the tree is reading how the scene was built.
    Selecting a step shows its values in the Inspector, editable in place. That
    is AEDT's shape — a model tree plus a property grid — and it is why there is
    no separate history panel: **there was one for two commits and it was a
    worse script tab**, one line of Python per row, duplicating both the tree
    and the script and adding only reordering. Steps are labelled for what they
    did (`_event_label`); the call that did it is the tooltip, and the script.
  - **Editing a step**: click it, or ✎ _Edit Step…_ which also focuses the
    Inspector — clicking a tree row and having values appear in another panel is
    not discoverable on its own, which is how it was found. The form takes
    expressions like every other numeric field, so **a variable can be put on a
    step after the fact**: type a name into an orbit's `angle` and the scene
    becomes parametric in something nobody planned for, prompting for the value
    if it is new (`edit_event` is in `MUTATING_WITH_VALUES` for exactly that).
    The label follows: "orbit stagger° about z".
  - **Rollback**, the other half of a CAD feature tree: right-click a step →
    _Build Up To Here_ folds only the events up to it, so you can watch the
    scene assemble. Steps after the point are dimmed and marked "not applied";
    the Scene title bar gains _Show The Whole Scene_ while it is active (context
    key `magpylib-studio.rolledBack`, read back from the engine rather than
    tracked in the UI). It is a **view**: `to_dict`, `to_script` and Save Scene
    As still see the whole document — only what is built is partial
    (`_objects_view`).
  - **Editing while rolled back inserts at that step**, the other half of the
    gesture: `_reposition_for_rollback` moves whatever a mutation appended into
    the rollback position and advances it, so several edits stack up in the
    order they were made, and the result carries `inserted_at` (the UI says so
    in the status bar — the scene on screen is a preview and looks like the
    whole). This is well defined _because_ a rolled-back scene holds only the
    objects that existed then: whatever you can act on is already there, so
    nothing inserted can refer to something created later. Anything that did not
    simply append — loading a document, editing the log itself — returns to the
    end instead, and `_folded_events` clamps the step when undo restores a
    shorter log.
  - The remaining panel called **Undo** is the session's snapshot stack, and is
    not history in the document sense: document copies, capped at 100, gone on
    reload.
  - Sliders commit on release, with the value box updating live during the drag.
    (They lived in the Inspector briefly, as a workaround for the tree; that
    section is gone now the Variables view can hold them itself — two places to
    edit the same number was worse than the tree limitation.)
  - **Every numeric field takes an expression**, not just the variables view:
    inspector properties and the transform pose (text inputs now — a number
    input cannot hold `gap*2` at all), the relative rotate/move fields, the Add
    Object prompts, Set Position…, Move By…, Rotate…. Expression fields render
    italic/blue and show the resolved value on hover. Multi-step paths still
    require numbers, because the UI divides the total across the steps. For this
    to be safe `get_params` and `get_transform` report the value **as written**
    (`written`, `written_position`, `written_orientation`) beside the resolved
    one — an editor showing only the resolved number would replace the
    expression the moment the user touched a neighbouring axis. `get_transform`
    falls back to the constructor param when no event pinned the pose, and
    `set_transform` records an expression as written instead of resolving it to
    a pose.
  - **Naming a variable creates it.** Type `a, a, 2*a` into a new cuboid's
    dimension and the studio asks for `a` before storing anything, then adds it
    to the stack — writing a name is how you say "and let me set this".
    `unknown_variables(values)` reports what a value refers to but the document
    does not define (functions and `pi`/`e`/`tau` are not variables, and the `=`
    marker keeps ordinary strings like `'z'` out of it);
    `ensureVariablesDefined` in the extension does the asking. It sits in
    `mutateFromTree` and in the inspector's request channel — a webview cannot
    raise an input box, so the ask happens on the way through — which covers
    every prompt, tree command and inspector field at once. Backing out of the
    prompt abandons the whole edit. LM tools deliberately bypass it: there is no
    one to ask, so Copilot gets the error and fixes it.
  - **LM tools cover the parametric surface**: `#magpyVars`, `#magpyVar`,
    `#magpyDuplicate`, `#magpySweep`, and the existing add/set/move/rotate
    descriptions now teach the `=expression` convention (a model that is not
    told will only ever write literals). `#magpyAdd` is explicitly steered away
    from adding ring magnets one at a time. `set_variable`, `remove_variable`
    and `duplicate_around` are batchable, so a whole parametric scene —
    variables, the object written in terms of them, the arrangement — is one
    undoable call. **Sweep a Variable…** ($(graph-line) in the same title bar)
    asks for from/to/steps and drives the Field panel's third mode, "Against a
    variable" (`get_sweep_figure`). **Duplicate Around…** is in the scene tree's
    Transform submenu.
  - **Generated copies are read-only, not inert**: they come back from
    `list_objects` with a `derived` key, and get `contextValue = 'derivedCopy'`
    — deliberately outside the `magpy*` namespace that all 14 scene-view menu
    entries are gated on, so none of them match. They are not draggable. They
    **are** selectable: they were not, and since 18 of the 24 rows in the
    Halbach example are copies, clicking a magnet did nothing at all and the
    Inspector stayed blank — which read as the panel being broken. Selecting one
    now opens it read-only, headed "generated from r1 — change that object, its
    pattern step, or the variables", and every write path in the Inspector
    refuses through one `refuseIfGenerated()` rather than each failing its own
    way at the engine. Without that they rendered as ordinary objects whose
    every command failed on the engine (and whose inspector _read_ fine, since
    `get_params` reads the live object, so they looked editable and silently
    weren't).
  - Layout: tree click → host `selectedObjectId` → inspector loads it; the
    Studio panel draws the scene with **three.js** (`media/scene3d.mjs`, one
    node per studio id) and can be worked in: pick, multi-select, drag, resize,
    aim, hide, play the paths. A **Chart** button swaps in the Plotly figure,
    read only, with its own animation toggle (template follows the VS Code
    theme). `broadcastMutation()` (debounced 150 ms) refreshes plot + tree +
    inspector + virtual docs after every edit from any surface (inspector
    widgets, LM tools, tree commands); a drag previews without it, paced one
    request in flight.
  - **Script/scene I/O**: read-only virtual doc `magpylib-studio:/scene.json`
    (to_dict) that live-updates on every edit; commands Edit Python Script
    ($(code) icon on the Scene view), Save Scene As… (.py or .json via
    extension), Load Scene from File… (JSON; also linked in the empty-view
    welcome).
  - **The script tab is editable both ways**: it is a real file in extension
    storage (a content provider has no write side), regenerated from the scene
    on every edit and applied back with `apply_script` on save — one undo step
    labelled "edit script". Edits are never clobbered while the buffer is dirty
    or while it holds text the engine rejected. `to_script` deliberately emits
    no wrapper Collection (`magpy.show(a, b, …)`), and the importer names nested
    children from script variables, so script → doc → script is an identity on
    ids and structure. **Two ways in, reported as `mode`:** _parsed_ — the file
    is still in the shape `to_script` emits, so `importer.parse_script` reads it
    as source: variables, event order and group transforms all survive, literals
    keep the form they were written in, and the whole document round-trips
    byte-identically (verified on the 24-object example). _executed_ — anything
    else (a loop, a helper, numpy) is run and introspected, which cannot see how
    the scene was written, so it warns about what it flattened. The script tab
    is therefore also the **only UI variables and duplicate events have**: you
    write them as Python, save, and they land in the document. Being a real
    file, VS Code restores its tab across a window reload — so the path is fixed
    at activation (not when the tab is first opened) and
    `adoptRestoredScriptTab` re-renders whatever was restored against the scene
    the engine has _now_; otherwise the tab silently shows the previous window's
    project until it is closed and reopened. That is also why the extension
    activates on `onStartupFinished`: a tab it owns can be on screen before the
    user asks for anything. Unsaved edits (hot exit) are still left alone.
  - Python resolution: `magpylib-studio.pythonPath` setting → workspace/.venv →
    repo-root/.venv → `python3`. Engine stderr → output channel.
  - Verified via `node` smoke test driving compiled `EngineClient` against the
    real engine: all methods, invalid-edit rejection, unknown-method rejection.
  - **Webview JavaScript lives in `media/*.js`**, loaded with `asWebviewUri`
    under a nonce CSP — the layout every `vscode-extension-samples` webview
    uses, and the reason is not tidiness. It used to sit inside TypeScript
    template literals, where the compiler sees only a string: a `\n` written
    singly was resolved by TypeScript into a real line break _inside a quoted
    string_, the emitted script had a syntax error, and the Inspector rendered
    as blank HTML with no error visible anywhere, because a script that cannot
    parse cannot report that it did not parse. 1,031 lines moved out;
    `src/webview.ts` holds the `nonce()` and `mediaUri()` both ends need, and
    `media/jsconfig.json` makes the editor check that code. Two guards now:
    `harness/check-webview-scripts.js` parses every `media/*.js` and refuses any
    `src/*.ts` that has grown a webview script back inside a template literal
    (wired into `npm run compile`, so a broken panel fails the build), and
    `harness/webview-harness.js` executes a panel's own script under a DOM shim
    against a real engine and prints the resulting DOM as text —
    `npm run inspect -- halbach`, or
    `node harness/webview-harness.js variables halbach`. Escapes meant for the
    webview must be doubled; if a panel is ever blank, run the checker first.
  - The other half of the same blind spot is the **message contract**: the host
    posting a type the webview does not handle is silent. That is how "what can
    go in a value" stayed empty — the Variables provider posted `{type:'help'}`
    on ready and the script had no branch for it, so `loadHelp()` was dead code.
    Both panels now end their handler with an `else` that puts
    `unhandled message: X` on screen.
  - **Tests now run inside a real Extension Development Host**: `npm test`
    (`@vscode/test-cli`, config in `.vscode-test.mjs`, suite in `src/test/`).
    Four so far, and they cover the seams nothing else could reach — activation,
    every declared command being registered, the engine subprocess answering
    through the virtual `scene.json`, a removal through the real command path
    taking a pattern's copies with it, and the script tab exporting the scene
    and applying an edited `radius` back on save. Webview _content_ stays with
    the DOM harness: a test cannot read into a webview. Two notes for whoever
    runs it: the user-data dir is forced into the system temp dir because a unix
    socket path cannot exceed 103 characters and this repo's path is deep enough
    to blow that; and `.vscode-test/` holds a 300 MB VS Code download, which is
    gitignored.
  - **Language model tools carry `prepareInvocation`**: an invocation line
    saying what is about to happen ("Removing r1", "Patterning r1 about an
    axis"), and for the three that destroy something — `clear_scene`,
    `remove_object`, `remove_event` — a confirmation that names it. The guide's
    point is that a dialog naming nothing in particular is one people click
    through, and `remove_object` in particular now says out loud that a
    pattern's copies go with the object. `check-contributions.js` also checks
    the tool contract (declared vs registered, and that each carries displayName
    / modelDescription / inputSchema), and an integration test asserts all 24
    are live in a real host.
  - **Checked against the API guides**, not only the samples: the two sidebar
    webviews dropped `retainContextWhenHidden` (the guide calls it a last resort
    for its memory cost, and both rebuild from the engine on ready); the two
    plotly panels keep it with the reason written down, since what would be lost
    is a camera the user positioned. Commands whose handler needs a tree object
    are hidden from the Command Palette with `when: false`, because the palette
    invokes them with nothing — `editOperation` and `toggleVisibility` were
    still leaking. `harness/check-contributions.js` now enforces all of that at
    build time: declared/registered/referenced commands agree, palette rules
    cover every argument-taking command, and every menu `when` clause matches a
    contextValue the tree can actually produce.
  - `npm run compile` is tsc + **eslint** (`eslint.config.mjs`, flat config,
    type-aware rules for `src/` and browser globals for `media/`) + the webview
    script check + the contribution check, so all of it runs before F5 and
    before packaging.

## Developing the extension

Open the **repo root** and press F5. There is no second window to open first:
the launch config lives at `.vscode/launch.json` and points
`--extensionDevelopmentPath` at `vscode-extension/`, so the engine stays in the
workspace where you can edit it. Two windows total — yours and the Extension
Development Host — which is how extension debugging works and as few as it goes.

The host opens `sandbox/`. That is deliberate: extension storage is _per
workspace_, and the script tab's `scene.py` lives there, so a host with no
folder open falls back to global storage shared with every other folder-less
window — which is how the script tab ended up showing a previous project's
scene. A fixed folder makes it deterministic.

Three configs: **Run Extension** (compiles first), **Run Extension (no build)**
for when `npm run watch` is already going, and **Extension Tests**.

## Setup (this folder)

```sh
uv venv --python 3.13 .venv
VIRTUAL_ENV=$PWD/.venv uv pip install -e ../magpylib   # REQUIRED: see below
VIRTUAL_ENV=$PWD/.venv uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Already set up: `.venv/` exists with the above installed. Git repo on `main`.
For the extension: `cd vscode-extension && npm install && npm run compile` (node
installed via Homebrew).

## magpylib versions — BOTH work

`magpylib_studio/style_compat.py` abstracts the only four branch-specific APIs
(`schema()`, `set(path,value)`, `set_values()`, resolved `get_style`):

- **Released magpylib (≥5.2)** — `pip install magpylib-studio` and done. The
  shim rebuilds set/set_values from `style.update()` / `style.as_dict()`
  (diffing a pristine style so defaults don't pollute the doc), and serves
  `style_schemas.json` — the branch's schema, generated once — as the schema.
  The two style trees match on 32 of 33 paths, so the inspector keeps real
  widgets. **Regenerate that file** (see its generation snippet in git history)
  if the branch's style tree changes.
- **Property-tree branch** (`feat/improve-style`, on the _official_ magpylib
  repo) — adds path-valued physics properties (`current=[100,200,300]`), the
  only feature the released version lacks.

Run the suite against both: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` (branch) and a
second venv with released magpylib (49 passed, 1 skipped — the property-path
test skips via `supports_property_paths()`).

One more difference, found the hard way and silent in the direction that
matters: **`show(backend="plotly", plotly_renderer=...)` does not reach the
figure on 5.2.3.** The `<backend>_<option>` passthrough arrived with the
display-backend registry, which that version does not have, so the argument is
dropped — no warning, no error, and plotly opens a browser tab as if nothing had
been asked for. Measured both ways, 0 files against 2. That is why
`viewer.draw_here()` sets plotly's own default renderer rather than passing one
through magpylib: it is the only route that works on every version this package
supports.

## Key design decisions (keep these)

1. **The scene document is the source of truth.** Every edit updates the live
   object AND `self.doc`, so `to_script()` always reflects current state → **git
   is the durable history**. (An _in-session_ undo/redo stack of doc snapshots
   exists for quick reverts — `undo`/`redo`/`get_history`/
   `goto_history(index)`, batch = one step, Cmd+Z in the panels, undo/redo
   icons + a clickable **History view** in the sidebar, `#magpyUndo` — it
   complements git, it does not replace it.)
2. **`schema()` is the one contract** — the same JSON Schema drives the frontend
   inspector widgets AND the LLM tool's `input_schema`.
3. **Shared validation** — every edit goes through `style.set`, validated by the
   property tree; bad edits are reported so a GUI shows an error and an LLM
   self-corrects. No second validation layer.
4. **Document canonical, script generated** (not AST-parsed). The reverse now
   exists as a pragmatic bridge: `load_script(path)` **executes** the user's
   script (show() patched out) and introspects the live objects into a document
   (`importer.py`) — variable names → ids, Collections keep nesting, orientation
   → one `rotations` entry. Parametric structure flattens (loops arrive as
   concrete objects). True AST parsing stays deferred on purpose.

5. **The saved file is `to_dict()`, versioned, and forgiving forwards.** Scenes
   save as `.magpy.json` — the document verbatim, no serializer in between to
   drift from it. Three rules, all tested, all easy to break by accident later:
   - `DOC_VERSION` (session.py) is stamped by `_canonical`, so _every_ document
     that passes through a session carries it. Absent = the format from before
     the field, and is migrated. **Higher than we know = refused** in
     `load_scene`, checked before the "is this a scene" test because a future
     format need not spell those keys our way.
   - **Unknown keys survive.** Top level and events are stored verbatim;
     `objects` is a projection, so unknown keys there are moved onto the create
     event by `_migrate_events` and projected back by `_project` (`_SPEC_KEYS` /
     `_CREATE_KEYS` are the "what we know" lists — extend both when adding a
     field). Without this, opening a v2 file in a v1 studio and saving would
     silently delete what v2 added.
   - **The script is an export, not a save.** Measured, not assumed: a
     `to_script` → `apply_script` round trip of the halbach example differs in
     exactly `variable_bounds` and `visible`. Physics survives; studio state
     does not. That is why Save writes JSON and Export writes `.py`. The schema
     lives at `vscode-extension/schemas/magpy-scene.schema.json` (registered via
     `contributes.jsonValidation`) and the Python suite validates every example
     against it — so it cannot describe a format the engine stopped writing.
6. **Redrawing is not editing.** `refreshSurfaces()` redraws; only
   `broadcastMutation()` marks the scene as differing from its file. They were
   one function, and Refresh and Build-Up-To-Here (a _view_) both put an
   unsaved-changes mark on a saved scene. Keep them apart.

7. **A pattern adds its copies in one call.** `Collection.add` rebuilds the
   collection's source and sensor lists on every invocation, so adding n
   children one at a time is quadratic — 400 ms against 1 ms for 2000 of them,
   measured. Both the engine (`_duplicate_around` / `_duplicate_along`) and the
   emitted script collect the copies and add them once; the script says
   `_copies = []` / `_copies.append(_copy)` / `group.add(*_copies)`, and
   `parse_script` still accepts the older per-copy `add` because scripts outlive
   the version that wrote them. A 6000-magnet halbach script went from 2.5 s to
   0.6 s. What is left is `copy()` (a deepcopy) and magpylib's own rotation,
   both linear and both profiled — do not go looking for more without measuring
   first.

8. **The window stamp says _where_, never _whether_.** The extension puts
   `MAGPYLIB_STUDIO_DROP` on its terminals (`environmentVariableCollection`), so
   a script the user runs knows which window to draw in. Measured, one launch
   method at a time:

   | launched by                   | stamped | right?                                                                                                                     |
   | ----------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   | integrated terminal           | yes     | yes                                                                                                                        |
   | Run button                    | yes     | yes                                                                                                                        |
   | F5 / debug                    | yes     | yes — debugpy's default console _is_ that terminal                                                                         |
   | Interactive Window            | **no**  | yes — the kernel is spawned from the extension host, and magpylib's `is_notebook()` already claims that context for plotly |
   | `pytest` in the same terminal | yes     | **no**                                                                                                                     |

   The last row is the finding. A test run and a human run differ in nothing the
   stamp can see: `stdout.isatty()` is True for both, because `pytest -s` keeps
   the tty attached. The only discriminator is `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`, and the
   set it belongs to — nox, tox, sphinx-build, nbconvert, a script rendering 200
   figures — cannot be enumerated.

   So: the address is stamped always and unconditionally; the backend name is a
   separate variable, written only because a setting says to. That setting
   (`magpylib-studio.drawScriptsHere`) ships **on**, so a plain `magpy.show()`
   draws in a panel — but as a default rather than an inference, which is the
   whole distinction. It is visible in `echo $MAGPYLIB_STUDIO_BACKEND`, a
   notice says so the first time a panel it produced appears, and one click
   turns it off.

   Test runs are excepted, and that takes two checks rather than one:
   `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` is set per test phase and is absent during
   _collection_, which is when the module that claims is imported — so the
   variable alone let a whole suite run claimed. `pytest in sys.modules` is
   what covers that moment. Neither is a general answer; nox, tox and
   sphinx-build are still out there, which is why this is a courtesy and the
   setting is the actual control.

   Corollary: nothing here may sniff `VSCODE_*`. Those variables are inherited
   by anything the extension host spawns — the Interactive Window's kernel has
   `VSCODE_PID` and `VSCODE_IPC_HOOK` — so keying on them would fire in exactly
   the context the notebook rule already owns. And the stamp crosses
   interpreters freely while the package does not: the runs above used three
   different pythons. Reaching the window is necessary, not sufficient.

## Reference material (in ../magpylib, branch feat/improve-style)

- `__temp_solara_app.py` — a WORKING Solara POC of the same GUI+LLM idea:
  schema-driven inspector + live plotly view + `claude-opus-5` chat editing the
  same style via `set_property`, with undo. Good reference for the frontend +
  the LLM tool-loop pattern (manual tool loop,
  `output_config={"effort":"low"}`).
- `src/magpylib/_src/defaults/property_tree.py` — the descriptor core
  (`PropertyNode`, `schema()`, `observe()`, `merged()`, ...).
- `src/magpylib/_src/style.py` — the ported style classes + `get_style`.
- Memory: the property-tree refactor rationale is in the magpylib repo's Claude
  memory (`style-property-tree-refactor`).

## Next steps (pick one)

- ~~**Publish the engine to PyPI — the real blocker for the Marketplace.**~~
  Both are done: `magpylib-studio` is on PyPI, the `magpylib` Marketplace
  publisher exists (registered through Azure DevOps, which is a separate thing
  from the GitHub org), and the release workflow publishes to both from one `v*`
  tag. That order was the point — with the engine installable by name, the "no
  interpreter found" error could become the **Install the Engine** button it now
  is, instead of "go and pip install this git URL".

  Still open from that entry: the LICENSE copyright line says "Alexandre
  Boisselet". That matches magpylib-force (which says "Michael Ortner"); the
  core library says "Silicon Austria Labs, Magpylib Developers". Worth
  confirming the house style with the other maintainers now that this is an org
  repo.

- **Custom editor / multi-document — the remaining stage of the persistence
  work.** Scenes are now files (`.magpy.json`, save/open/revert, a dirty mark in
  the Scene view title, a crash backup, reopen-on-activation), but the studio
  still holds _one_ scene with the file name kept beside it in `extension.ts`.
  The standard shape is `CustomEditorProvider` (the editable flavour —
  `custom-editor-sample` upstream), which brings a real tab, the dirty dot,
  `Cmd+S`, Save As, revert, hot exit and several scenes at once, all correct and
  free. Two costs: the engine is one global session in `rpc.py`, and **engine
  cold start is 0.26 s measured**, so a process per open document is affordable
  and much simpler than multiplexing sessions into the protocol; and the four
  sidebar views are singletons that would have to follow the active editor —
  that is the real work. Undo should delegate to the engine's stack rather than
  VS Code owning a second one. Doing this retires
  `sceneFile`/`sceneDirty`/`restoreScene`; the dirty-tracking discipline (see
  design decision 6) carries over.

- **Run it in an Extension Development Host** — overdue. The document schema
  changed twice (events, variables) and the UI gained a view, three commands and
  a Field-panel mode, all verified only by `tsc`, the engine test suite and a
  node smoke test against the real engine. F5 and check: the Variables view
  edits and re-renders, Duplicate Around… produces inert `m#1…` rows, the sweep
  plots, and the script tab still applies on save.
- **Units are still absent, deliberately** (see below) — the one open question
  on the parametric side.
- **Units are still absent, deliberately** — everything is bare SI, as magpylib
  wants. If ANSYS-style `5mm` values are ever wanted, that is a layer over
  `expressions.py`, and it needs deciding before variables get used widely
  enough that migrating them hurts.
- **Undo is still snapshots.** `_undo` holds whole document copies, so the
  History view and the event log remain two mechanisms that look alike. Now that
  structure is event-sourced, undo could become a pointer into the log — except
  variables and bounds are not events, so it would only be honest once they are
  too. That is the remaining half of the unification.
- **Undo stays snapshots, on purpose.** It cannot become a pointer into the log,
  because the log is deliberately _not_ append-only: what an object is lives on
  its create event and is edited in place, so the log does not hold the previous
  value to step back to. Making it hold one means appending every slider drag.
  AEDT is the same shape — a history tree plus a separate undo — and for the
  same reason.
- The events panel shows the log but cannot yet **drag** to reorder (↑/↓ buttons
  only), and editing a create event's params redirects you to the Inspector
  rather than doing it in place.
- **Optimisation** on top of `sweep()` (find the gap that flattens the field) is
  a small step now that a rebuild-and-measure loop exists.
- **Try it live**: open `vscode-extension/` in VS Code, F5, run "Magpylib
  Studio: Open Scene View"; in Copilot chat try `make the cube green #magpyEdit`
  or `add a green sphere at [0,2,0] #magpyAdd`.
- **Click-to-select in the 3D view** — needs solving magpylib's merged traces
  first (one mesh per collection, so hit-testing needs per-object rendering or a
  vertex-range → object map). Spike before promising.
- **Package a .vsix** (vsce) once features settle, for real installs — also
  needs an install story for the engine (unreleased magpylib branch).
- **No TypeScript tests** — ~1.5k lines verified only by `tsc` + manual F5; a
  `@vscode/test-electron` harness would cover tree/clipboard/commands.
- **Chat Participant `@magpy`** if richer chat UX than plain tools is wanted.

## Gotchas

- `to_script` **folds the log in order** — create → definition, transform →
  call, pattern → loop — rather than hoisting every definition above every step.
  It used to hoist, and that is wrong the moment a pattern is involved: an
  object added to an already-patterned group was defined above the loop that
  copies the group, so the script built it into every copy too (13 sources in
  the scene, 15 in its own script, different field). The price of the fix is
  that a Collection is written before its children exist, so they join with
  `.add(child)` instead of constructor arguments — `parse_script` tells that
  apart from the `.add()` a mirror uses by the argument being a bare name rather
  than a call, and from a pattern's `.add(_copy)` by that one living inside a
  `for`. Guarded by
  `test_the_script_builds_the_scene_whatever_order_it_was_built_in`.

  `parse_script` therefore emits **create events itself, in position**, instead
  of leaving them for `_migrate_events` to synthesise at the front — otherwise
  the round trip re-hoists what the script got right. Their key order matches
  what the engine writes (`op, target, type, params, style, parent`) so
  `to_dict()` stays byte-identical across the trip.

- The `get_figure` result is `json.loads(fig.to_json())` — plotly's encoder
  handles numpy/bdata; don't use `to_plotly_json()` (leaves numpy in, not
  JSON-safe).
- Style paths are **dotted** (`magnetization.arrow.width`); `to_script` nests
  them for the `style=` kwarg. Constructor `style=` needs nested, not dotted.
- LLM: for a VS Code extension prefer `vscode.lm` (Copilot, zero key). Use the
  Anthropic SDK path from the Solara POC only if you specifically want Claude
  and are OK managing keys/chat UI.
