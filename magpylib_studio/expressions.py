"""Spreadsheet-style expressions, so a scene can be parameterized.

Any string beginning with `=` is an expression over the document's
variables; anything else is a literal. That one rule keeps `"z"` an axis
name and `"=turn/n"` arithmetic without a per-field whitelist — a value
can be an expression anywhere a number can, in constructor params and in
event fields alike.

Expressions are evaluated from their AST against an explicit allow-list,
never with eval() on arbitrary source: a document is something you open
from someone else, so it must not be able to run code. (The script tab is
