"""Headless magpylib editing engine — the framework-agnostic core of the studio.

A `MagpylibStudioSession` owns a scene built from a structured *document* and
exposes exactly the operations any frontend (VS Code webview, Solara, a CLI…)
needs. The document is the source of truth: every edit updates both the live
magpylib object and the document, so `to_dict()` / `to_script()` always reflect
the current state and can be versioned in git.

    cuboids (each orbited AND spun by the ring angle, the classic magpylib

    path along the bore axis.

    Written the way the studio is meant to be used, because it is the first
    thing anyone opens: each ring is ONE magnet and one pattern step, not ten
    declared magnets, so the whole scene is nine steps and four variables.
    Changing `n` rebuilds both rings, and `stagger` follows it without being
    touched, being half a magnet step by definition.

    Soft bounds mark the range worth exploring — below a radius of about 1.6
    the ten unit cubes of the default ring would have to overlap (2πr < n) —
    while the hard bounds only rule out the physically impossible.

    The sample runs over one index and splits it into a row and a column,
    because a sampled node draws one run of points. magpylib takes any
    (…, 3) pixel array, so a flat run of density² points is the same grid to

          the single equivalent transform, group transforms baked into the
