 *     own PATH probing is exactly how this feature's first version shipped
 *     with a bug (bare `python3` resolving to whatever a GUI-launched VS
 *     Code's minimal PATH happens to contain).
 *  2. `uv`, if installed — it fetches a matching Python itself on demand,
 *     so unlike PATH probing it does not depend on anything already being
 *     installed, and it is what this very repo's own setup already uses.
 *  3. A login-shell-resolved `python3` (or `python`/`py` on Windows) as a
 *     last resort, version-checked before use rather than trusted blindly —
 *     a fresh machine can genuinely have nothing newer than an OS-bundled
 *     Python outside of tool-managed venvs, which is a real state to
 *     report clearly rather than let pip's own error text stand in for.
 *
 *  getEngine() has ~40 call sites, many of which can fire near-simultaneously
 *  on activation, so more than one "no interpreter" dialog can be on screen
 *  at once — this guards against two clicks racing two installs into the
 *  same venv by sharing one in-flight run instead of starting a second. */
