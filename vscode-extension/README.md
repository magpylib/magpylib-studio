# Magpylib Studio VS Code Extension

VS Code shell for the headless `magpylib-studio` engine (the Python package in
the repo root). It spawns `python -m magpylib_studio` and talks
newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio.

<!-- Absolute, not relative. vsce rewrites relative image paths against the
     *repository* root it reads from package.json, and this extension lives in
     a subfolder of that repo — so `../docs/halbach.png` becomes a 404 on the
     Marketplace listing while looking right on GitHub. -->

![The Halbach example open in VS Code: the scene tree listing each ring's construction steps and the copies a pattern made, the variables panel with sliders for n, radius, gap, stagger and tilt, the 3D view, and the script tab showing the same scene as parametric magpylib.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magpylib/magpylib-studio/main/docs/halbach.png)

_The `halbach` example: twenty magnets from two `create` steps and two circular
patterns. Dragging `n` rebuilds both rings; the script tab on the right is the
same scene, and saving an edit to it rebuilds the scene from what you wrote._

## What it provides

- **Command** `Magpylib Studio: Open Scene View` — the "Magpylib Scene" tab: a
  live three.js scene you can work in. Click an object to select it, ⌘-click to
  add to the selection, and drag the handles to move (W), turn (E), resize (R)
  or aim a polarization (P) — along world or object axes, snapping to round
  steps with S. Paths play, with a scrubber. Every drag is one step in the
  history and one undo, and the field follows as you go. A **Chart** button
  swaps in the Plotly figure, which is read only and has its own animation.
- **Scene view** — the magpylib-logo icon in the activity bar opens a sidebar
  tree of the scene's objects, nested as they are grouped, one icon per type
  (magnets red, currents blue, sensors green). Clicking an object opens the plot
  and loads it in the Inspector. The scene starts **empty**: the view offers
  **Load Example Scene…**, which picks between six — a Halbach stack, a
  solenoid, a mirrored pair, a magnet array, a parametric measuring plane and a
  turning magnet with field arrows, each built from a couple of steps rather
  than a heap of objects.
- **The construction history is in that tree**, under the object it happened to:
  expand a magnet and you get _created_, _orbit 36° about z_, and so on, before
  whatever it contains. Steps are named for what they did; the call that did it
  is the tooltip. Hover one for _Edit Step…_ (its values open in the Inspector,
  expressions included), move it earlier or later — order is semantic — or
  remove it. Editing an early step re-applies everything after it; anything that
  no longer applies is flagged in place with the reason, rather than the edit
  being refused.
- **Build Up To Here** on a step folds only the history before it, so you can
  watch the scene assemble — and anything you do while rolled back is _inserted
  at that step_. The Scene title bar offers _Show The Whole Scene_ while it is
  active.
- **Variables view** — named values the scene is written in terms of. Each row
  is a value box and, once it has bounds, a slider; dragging one moves
  everything defined against it. A variable that is a _choice_ rather than a
  quantity gets a dropdown instead — a rotation axis is `z`, which is a name, so
  no range describes it and no slider can offer it. The halbach example ships
  with one: `tilt_axis` picks which way `tilt` tips the whole stack.
  Whole-number variables are refused fractional values outright, because a count
  of 7.3 is meaningless rather than merely imprecise. Values may be expressions
  over the other variables (`360 / n`), with the allowed operators, functions
  and constants listed in the panel and checked as you type. `⋯` lists what a
  variable is — its name, its limits, its kind — each entry showing what it
  holds; renaming from there rewrites everything written in terms of it. **Sweep
  a Variable…** plots the field against one in the Field view.
- **Undo view** — the session's checkpoints, newest first: click any to jump the
  scene there, backwards or forwards. This is _not_ the construction history
  above; it is document snapshots, and it is gone on reload.
- **Add Object…** — the `+` icon on the Scene view (or right-click a collection
  to create inside it, or the empty-view welcome): pick a type (cuboid,
  cylinder, segment, sphere, tetrahedron, current loop/polyline, dipole, sensor,
  collection), then set each of its properties — prefilled with defaults and
  labelled with units — and it opens selected in the Inspector.
- **Editing in the tree** — Rename (`F2`, `Enter` on macOS), Copy / Cut / Paste
  (`Cmd/Ctrl+C` / `X` / `V`) and Delete (`Delete`, `Cmd+Backspace`) while the
  Scene view has focus, plus the same items on right-click. A copy follows
  magpylib's own convention (`Cube` → `Cube_01` → `Cube_02`) and copies a
  collection's whole subtree; pasting onto a collection puts the object inside
  it. The eye icon on hover hides an object from the 3D view (dimmed in the
  tree, like toggling a plotly trace) — hidden sources still count in field
  calculations.
- **Right-click → Transform** — Set Position…, Move By…, Rotate… (spin or orbit
  the origin), Clear Path, Pixel Grid…, and **Pattern…**: one step standing for
  N copies, _around an axis_ (a ring, a rotor, a Halbach array), _along a
  direction_ (do it twice for a grid), or _mirrored_ — where the polarization
  reflects as an axial vector should, which is the part that is easy to get
  wrong by hand. Counts and steps may be variables, so the whole arrangement
  stays one number to edit.
- **Field maps** — the Field panel's _Plane map_ mode: a heatmap of |B| (or a
  signed component) on the xy/xz/yz plane at any offset, with a log option
  because field spans orders of magnitude. Colour follows the data's job — one
  hue light→dark for magnitude, blue↔grey↔red anchored at zero for signed
  components — and the axes are locked 1:1 so geometry is not distorted.
  Right-click a Sensor → **Transform → Pixel Grid…** builds magpylib's own pixel
  grid instead: the measurement plane is then a real object, visible in the 3D
  view, tilting with the sensor and exported in the script.
- **Pose** — the Inspector's `pose` section: the object's absolute position and
  rotation vector, showing the expression a value was written as beside what it
  currently comes to. Relative moves and rotations are not here; they record a
  _step_, so they live on the tree's Transform menu. Same operations in chat:
  `#magpyMove`, `#magpyRotate`, `#magpyPose`.
- **Saving and opening scenes** — a scene is a document: **Save** (`Cmd/Ctrl+S`
  with the Scene view focused) writes it to a `.magpy.json` file, and the view
  title shows which file it is and a `•` while it differs from what is on disk.
  Double extension on purpose — the file stays JSON to git, to diffs and to
  schema validation, while still being a name VS Code can associate, so
  right-clicking one in the explorer offers _Open Scene_. The format carries its
  own version number and keeps fields it does not recognise, so a scene written
  by a later studio is refused with a clear message rather than opened half-way
  and saved back over. **Export as Python Script…** is the other direction:
  runnable magpylib anyone can use without the studio — but it carries no slider
  bounds and no hidden flags, which is why it is an export and not a save.
  Opening a scene, loading an example or importing a script asks first if there
  is unsaved work.
- **A reload does not lose the scene.** It lives in a subprocess that dies with
  the window, so the studio writes a backup after every edit and comes back to
  the scene you were editing next time the workspace opens — unsaved changes
  included, and still marked unsaved. It does this without asking and without
  opening anything, the way VS Code restores an unsaved editor: the scene is in
  the tree when you look, and _New Scene_ discards it if you would rather start
  over.
- **The script tab is editable both ways** — _Edit Python Script_ renders the
  scene as runnable magpylib, and saving it rebuilds the scene from what you
  wrote, as one undo step. Variables and patterns survive the round trip intact;
  a script the studio cannot parse is executed instead, and what that flattens
  is reported. It is a view of the current scene, not a saved file: a tab VS
  Code restores after a reload is re-rendered against whatever scene is loaded
  now (unsaved edits excepted), so it never shows the last project.
- **Properties** — the Inspector's `properties` section: the object's physics
  parameters (polarization, dimension, diameter, current, moment, vertices,
  pixels) as numeric widgets, with units in the tooltips; matrices like polyline
  vertices are edited as JSON. Edits go through `set_param`, so transforms and
  styles are preserved.
- **Inspector view** — below the tree: schema-driven widgets generated from
  `get_schema()` (enum → dropdown, `format: color` → color picker + text,
  bounded number → slider, boolean → tri-state with "(default)"), prefilled with
  resolved values. Explicitly set paths are bold with a ↺ reset button; a filter
  box narrows the property list. Edits go through `apply_edit` / `reset_style`,
  so magpylib validation errors show inline.

All three surfaces (plot, tree, inspector) refresh automatically after any edit,
whatever its origin — inspector widget, chat tool, or tree context menu.

- **Language Model Tools** (native Copilot chat, no API key): `#magpyObjects`
  (list scene objects), `#magpySchema` (style JSON Schema for an object),
  `#magpyEdit` (set one dotted style path, validated by magpylib), `#magpyAdd` /
  `#magpyRemove` (add/remove scene objects), `#magpyParam` (constructor params:
  move, resize, repolarize), `#magpyClear` (empty the scene in one call),
  `#magpyBatch` (many operations in one call — the tool descriptions steer the
  model to it for multi-object work), `#magpyVars` / `#magpyVar` /
  `#magpyBounds` (the scene's variables), `#magpyDuplicate` / `#magpyRow` /
  `#magpyMirror` (patterns, which the descriptions steer the model to instead of
  adding ring magnets one at a time), `#magpySweep` (the field against a
  variable) and `#magpyEvents` / `#magpyEditEvent` / `#magpyMoveEvent` /
  `#magpyRemoveEvent` (the construction history). Edits auto-refresh all
  surfaces, debounced so bursts redraw once.

Both the webview and the LM tools share one engine process
([src/engineClient.ts](src/engineClient.ts) — promise-based RPC client that owns
the request-id space).

## Try it out

**1. Install the extension** — search **Magpylib Studio** in the Extensions
view, or:

```sh
code --install-extension magpylib.magpylib-studio-vscode
```

Or install the `.vsix` attached to the [latest release][releases], which is the
same build — the asset is named for the tag, not for the package:

```sh
code --install-extension magpylib-studio-<tag>.vsix
```

[releases]: https://github.com/magpylib/magpylib-studio/releases

**2. Let it install the engine.** The extension is only the UI — it spawns
`python -m magpylib_studio` — but that is not a step you do first. Open a folder
and use the extension; when it cannot find an interpreter with the engine, it
offers **Install the Engine**, which

- offers the interpreter the Python extension already has selected, if it meets
  the ≥ 3.11 floor — named in the prompt, and declinable, because that one may
  be a system Python and "install the engine" is not consent to change it;
  otherwise, or if you decline,
- creates a `.venv` in the workspace, fetching a matching Python via [uv][uv]
  when uv is installed and falling back to `python -m venv`; then
- `pip install magpylib-studio` into it, and sets `magpylib-studio.pythonPath`
  to it in workspace settings.

To do it yourself instead, any interpreter ≥ 3.11 with the engine on it works —
`pip install magpylib-studio`, then point `magpylib-studio.pythonPath` at it.
Either way you get released magpylib, which is fully supported. The
[property-tree branch][branch] is optional and adds path-valued physics
properties (`current=[100, 200, 300]`):

```sh
pip install "magpylib @ git+https://github.com/magpylib/magpylib@feat/improve-style"
```

[uv]: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

**3. Open it.** Click the magpylib icon in the activity bar, press **Load
Example Scene…** and take the Halbach stack. Then, in rough order of what the
tool is for:

- open **Variables** and drag `n` — twenty magnets rebuild from one number;
- expand a ring in the tree to see the steps that built it, and _Edit Step…_ on
  the orbit to change it after the fact;
- **Sweep a Variable…** on `gap` to plot the field against it;
- _Edit Python Script_ to see the whole thing as parametric magpylib, edit a
  line, and save it back;
- `Cmd/Ctrl+S` with the Scene view focused to save it as `scene.magpy.json`,
  then reload the window — it comes back;
- with GitHub Copilot installed, ask chat `make the magnets green #magpyEdit` or
  `a ring of 8 dipoles at radius 5 #magpyDuplicate`.

## Working on it

Nothing above needs a clone; this does. Take the repo, install the node
dependencies, then open the **repo root** in VS Code and press `F5`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/magpylib/magpylib-studio.git
cd magpylib-studio/vscode-extension && npm install && cd ..
code .          # the repo root, not vscode-extension/
```

`F5` compiles (tsc, eslint and three checks over the webviews, the contributions
and the version) and opens one further window — the Extension Development Host,
with the extension loaded and `sandbox/` as its workspace. Two windows total,
which is as few as extension debugging goes. The launch config lives at the repo
root deliberately: opening `vscode-extension/` as its own workspace works too,
but then the Python engine is outside the window you are editing in.

Other configs on the F5 menu: **Run Extension (no build)** for when
`npm run watch` is already running, and **Extension Tests**. From a terminal the
equivalents are `npm run compile`, `npm run watch` and `npm test` — the last
downloads a VS Code build the first time and runs the suite in a real host.

To install your build into your normal VS Code, package it — note that vsce
names the file after the package and version, where a release asset is named
after the tag:

```sh
npx @vscode/vsce package        # -> magpylib-studio-vscode-<version>.vsix
```

Releases are tag-driven: bump `package.json` and rename the changelog's
`[Unreleased]` heading in one commit, then push a `v*` tag.
`npm run check:version` keeps those two honest on every build, and the release
workflow checks the tag against both before it publishes anything.

## Python interpreter resolution

1. `magpylib-studio.pythonPath` setting, if set;
2. `.venv/bin/python` (or `Scripts\python.exe`) in a workspace folder, then in
   the repo root next to this folder;
3. `python3` on PATH.

The probe checks each candidate can actually `import magpylib_studio`, so a
workspace `.venv` without the engine cannot shadow a working interpreter.

## Notes

- plotly.js is bundled from `plotly.js-dist-min` (3.x, matching Python plotly
  6.x) and loaded via a webview URI — no CDN, works offline, CSP-clean.
- Engine stderr goes to the "Magpylib Studio Engine" output channel.
